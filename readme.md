**This project:**
-
Create a program to be a "mathemagician".

In the first example, circles.


> `Start` your program working out what the features of a circle are and how to calculate them.
>
eg Area, Circumference, Diameter, Radius

Then develop a program to prompt for a relevant input and calculate the properties.

> Create an `attractive` User interface.

Key things yoo could do: Create a nice menu page using appropriate ASCII art ?
