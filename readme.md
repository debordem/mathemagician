**This project:**

Create a program to be a "mathemagician".

In the first example, circles.

Start your program working out what the features of a circle are and how to calculate them.

Then develop a program to prompt for a relevant input and calculate the properties.

User Interface.

Key things to do: Create a nice menu page, ASCII art ?
Loop the program until the user exits.

Start with circles.... then develop with more shapes...
